# React weather app

A simple single-page React app that pulls weather information from OpenWeatherAPI and (crudely) displays it in a dynamic manner. Mainly done for learning, so takes some shortcuts.

Uses React and OpenWeatherAPI, of course, as well as Bootstrap (no custom CSS written for this project). Thrown together in a few hours.
